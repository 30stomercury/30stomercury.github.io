# About me
Hi! I'm Brian S. Yeh, 
currently a M.S. student in EE at National Tsing Hua University.
My current research is in the field of speech processing and machine learning with my advisor 
Prof. [Chi-Chun Lee](https://biic.ee.nthu.edu.tw/cclee.php). <br/>
Especially, I'm now concentrated in developing end-to-end approach combines Speech Recognition and Emotino Recognition. 
Moreover, I'm also interested in NLP with research experiences in [text generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.02095).
